*Real-Time Hand-Tracking Drawing App with Color and Thickness Selection*

Description:
This project leverages OpenCV, NumPy, and MediaPipe to create a real-time drawing application using hand gestures. It enables users to draw on a canvas by tracking hand movements via a webcam.

 Key features include:
Hand Gesture Recognition: Uses MediaPipe for hand tracking to detect finger positions.

Color and Thickness Selection: Users can select colors (white, green, red, black) and line thickness (thin, medium, thick) through predefined areas on the screen.

Dynamic Drawing: Draws lines on a canvas based on finger movement, with support for clearing the canvas.
The app features interactive controls for color and thickness, providing a simple and intuitive drawing experience.
