# ✍️ Hand Gesture Drawing App

## Objective
This project is a real-time hand gesture-controlled drawing application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas by tracking hand movements using OpenCV and MediaPipe.

## Tools
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video capture and drawing on the canvas.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand detection and tracking.
- **NumPy**: For handling canvas arrays.
- **Python**: Primary language for implementation.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Hand Gesture Drawing**: Users can draw on the screen by moving their hands, and the application tracks hand landmarks to draw strokes.
- **Color and Thickness Selection**: Offers multiple colors (white, green, red, black) and different stroke thickness options (thin, medium, thick).
- **Clear Canvas Option**: Users can clear the drawing area by selecting the "CLEAR" button.
- **Gesture-Based Controls**: Hand gestures are used to select colors, stroke thickness, and clear the canvas, providing a touchless interface.
